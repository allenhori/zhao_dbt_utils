{#
  zhao_utils -- wref() / zhao_window_start() / zhao_window_end()

  Full design rationale lives in README.md. Short version: dbt's own
  microbatch ref() filtering is hardcoded (not macro-overridable -- see
  README for why), so a real ref() to an upstream model still gets dbt's
  default single-batch window, silently under-reading it when the
  *current* (downstream) model needs a wider read. These macros read
  the SAME meta.zhao block zhao-dbt-plan's own planner reads -- never a
  second place to maintain the numbers.

  NAMING: this package's own arguments are `expand_back`/`expand_forward`
  -- deliberately NOT `lookback`/`lookahead`, to avoid confusion with
  dbt's own unrelated native `lookback` model config (which means "re-
  process N past batches," a completely different concept). Internally
  these map directly to meta.zhao's `lookback`/`lookahead` keys, which
  are UNCHANGED and NOT renamed -- that vocabulary is already
  established and documented within zhao-dbt-plan itself, where the
  namespacing (`meta.zhao.lookback`) already disambiguates it from dbt's
  own config. The rename only applies here, at the macro call site,
  which is the one place a bare, unnamespaced `lookback=N` would
  actually risk being confused with dbt's own `config(lookback=N)`
  sitting on the very same model.

  IMPORTANT: meta.zhao lives on the DOWNSTREAM model doing the reading,
  not on the upstream being read -- e.g. `mb_orders_rolling_7d` (which
  calls `wref('mb_orders_daily')`) carries the meta.zhao block on
  *itself*, describing how far back/forward *it* needs to read from its
  upstreams. `lookback_overrides`/`lookahead_overrides` are keyed by the
  upstream's bare name, for per-upstream overrides of the model's own
  default lookback/lookahead. This exactly matches zhao-dbt-plan's own
  planner semantics (see zhao-dbt-plan's src/manifest.rs) -- confirmed
  against the real fixture project during testing, after an earlier
  version of this file had the lookup direction backwards.

  v1 scope: only `lookback_unit`/`lookahead_unit: day` and `week` are
  supported. `month`/`year` raise a clear compile error rather than
  silently producing an approximate (and possibly wrong) result --
  calendar month/year arithmetic is warehouse-dialect-dependent and out
  of scope for this first version.

  `execute` guards throughout: `graph` (and everything derived from it)
  is only fully populated once `execute` is true -- dbt's real
  compile/run pass. During the earlier parse-time pass, where dbt
  statically discovers ref()/source()/config() calls to build the
  dependency graph in the first place, `graph` doesn't have real
  contents yet, and this package's real logic can't run. Parse-time
  doesn't need a correct return value, only one that renders without
  crashing -- every macro below that ultimately depends on `graph`
  short-circuits to a harmless placeholder in that case, confirmed via
  a real dbt-core run against this exact failure mode.

  Usage note: call these with the package namespace prefix --
  `{{ zhao_utils.wref(...) }}`, not bare `{{ wref(...) }}` -- confirmed
  via testing that bare calls to an installed package's macros don't
  resolve in dbt-core 1.10 without extra setup. If you want bare calls
  anyway, add a short wrapper macro to your OWN project (not this
  package) -- see README.md's "Bare calls, if you want them" section
  for the exact, tested snippet. No dbt_project.yml changes needed for
  that -- just one small macro file in your own project.

{#- Finds the graph node for a bare model name -- used only to look up
    an UPSTREAM model's own `event_time` column (which genuinely does
    live on that model, unlike meta.zhao). Errors loudly if the name
    doesn't resolve to anything -- a typo here should never be mistaken
    for "no event_time configured". Only call this when `execute` is
    true (see module doc comment). -#}
